**Internships**

Last year I had the chance to work as an intern for the Ministry of the Defense in Brest, at the Atlantic Maritime Prefecture. 

I contributed with a pair to the creation of automated dashboards: one for the Defence Base Commander (COMBdD) and the other for the Social Action of the Army (ASA). The first dashboard summarises indicators of the evolution of civilian and military personnel since 2013, the budget (allocation, monitoring of the provision of delegated appropriations and monitoring of consumption), the evolution of surveys on the Quality of Service Rendered (QSR), details of material resources and comitology. It also includes a mapping of the formations and personnel of the Brest-Lorient defence base.
The second dashboard produced for Social Action of the Army gathers, from data collected in the frame of the "[Family Plan](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/english/familles/votre-espace/plan-d-accompagnement-des-familles/les-mesures-du-plan-famille)", social indicators about the personnel of the defence base. A parallel study based on these data made it possible to determine the best location for the construction of a military "crèche" (nursery) on the defence base.

This year, I am working as a research intern for IQVIA France in Courbevoie (Paris La Défense). The objective of the internship is to find machine learning methods to identify and cluster care pathways for diabetic patients. It is a retrospective longitudinal database analysis study (IQVIA database: LifelinkTM Treatments Dynamics, LTD). The study consists of following treatment-naive diabetic patients. In other words, the first line of treatment is defined by the absence of delivery of any anti-diabetic medication in the 12 months preceding this first delivery. The patient will be considered to start his or her first treatment on this date; the patient will therefore be defined as treatment-naive. This design will make it possible to study a cohort of patients reflecting the current distribution of anti-diabetic treatments in order to give the most recent picture of the drug management of diabetes in France.
