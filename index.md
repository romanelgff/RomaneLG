**Work experience**

***2022-now - Biostatistican (IQVIA France, Courbevoie)***

As a biostatistician at IQVIA France, my work primarily focuses on projects utilizing the National Health Data System (Système Nationale des Données de Santé or SNDS in French). The SNDS is a comprehensive collection of databases that consolidates medico-administrative information related to healthcare utilization, socio-demographic data, and hospital stays of the French population. In addition, I am actively gaining expertise in analyzing data from Electronic Medical Records and pharmacy dispensation databases available at IQVIA.

**Internships**

***2022 - Data scientist intern (IQVIA France, Courbevoie)***

During the course of a patient's healthcare journey, they receive individualized treatment and care prescriptions tailored to their specific needs, making each individual's care pathway unique. It is crucial to identify the various possible treatment trajectories for a particular condition in order to characterize the evolution of therapies over time. The objective of the internship was to explore and compare methods that enable the grouping of similar care trajectories, with the aim of identifying "typical pathways" followed by patients.

***2021 - Data analyst intern (Atlantic Maritime Prefecture, Brest)***

During the internship, the focus was on developing automated dashboards for two different entities. The first dashboard was designed for the Defence Base Commander (COMBdD), providing a comprehensive overview of various indicators such as the evolution of civilian and military personnel since 2013, budget allocation and monitoring, Quality of Service Rendered (QSR) surveys, details of material resources, and comitology. Additionally, it included a mapping feature displaying formations and personnel of the Brest-Lorient defence base.

The second dashboard was developed for the Social Action of the Army (ASA) and gathered social indicators related to the personnel of the defence base, using data collected within the scope of the "[Family Plan](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/english/familles/votre-espace/plan-d-accompagnement-des-familles/les-mesures-du-plan-famille)". Furthermore, a parallel study based on these data enabled the identification of the optimal location for constructing a military "crèche" (nursery) on the defence base.
