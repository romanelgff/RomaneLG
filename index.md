This year I had the chance to work as an intern for the Ministry of the Defense in Brest. 

I contributed with a pair to the creation of automated dashboards: one for the Defence Base Commander (COMBdD) and the other for the Social Action of the Army (ASA). The first summarises indicators of the evolution of civilian and military personnel since 2013, the budget (allocation, monitoring of the provision of delegated appropriations and monitoring of consumption), the evolution of surveys on the Quality of Service Rendered (QSR), details of material resources and comitology. It also includes a mapping of the formations and personnel of the Brest-Lorient defence base.
The second dashboard produced for social action gathers, from data collected for the Family Plan, indicators on the Navy personnel of the defence base. A parallel study based on these data made it possible to determine the best location for the construction of a "crèche" (nursery) on the Lorient basin.

My internship report as well as the report I wrote with my pair on the nursery project are confidential, but I will shortly add non-confidential versions of them on this page once I am allowed to do so.
